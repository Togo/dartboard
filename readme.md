#About

A simple Darts scoring web app written with Node.js. Written for two simple reasons:
* I was itching to write something with Node.js.
* We have Darts at the office and there's no decent free Darts scoring app I could find ;)

##Dependencies

Dartboard uses:

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [mongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)

And depends on these packages (version number after package name - with which latest version of that package it was tested):

* [connect 1.0.6](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect)
* [express 2.0.0beta3](http://expressjs.com/)
* [expresso 0.7.3](http://visionmedia.github.com/expresso/)
* [jade 0.8.6](http://jade-lang.com/)
* [less 1.0.41](http://lesscss.org/)
* [mongoose 1.1.4](http://mongoosejs.com/)
* [should 0.0.4](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js)
* [underscore 1.1.4](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/)

It is recommended (and easier) to install packages using [npm](http://npmjs.org/).

Tested on [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) 10.10.
